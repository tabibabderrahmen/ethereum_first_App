this is a simple application for smart contract : creation,test,deployment without frontend part.

First you should install all the dependancies : 
cd to the right folder then fire in the cmd : npm install

Then to run the tests : 
you should fire in the cmd : npm run test 

you will see this results if everything go successfully otherwise you can contact me : abdou1tabib@gmail.com

After that you would deploy this smart contract using this command in the cmd : node deploy.js
but before that you need to replace those arguments with the right ones : 
'REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_MNEMONIC' : //using your Metamask mnemonic 
'REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_INFURA_URL' : // using your url after signing up in infura and setting your test network

Finally you would see this message and get you smart contract adress to keep tracking on https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/
